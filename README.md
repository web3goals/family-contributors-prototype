## ‚ö° About

The current generation of adults finds blockchain and cryptocurrencies hard to accept. They have already formed habits, and it is difficult for them to accept something new.

So I suggest focus on children, they adapt to technology more quickly. Together with them, blockchain can reach into all spaces and make this world more transparent and honest.

That is why I decided to build this project. Family Contributors is an app where parents reward their children for valuable actions using web3 technology.
